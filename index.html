      <p>I am loving learning to code and am committed to a lifelong learning of programming. I am going to keep pushing myself and hope to inspire other women to do the same. I volunteer with Girl Develop It and attend PyLadies meetups to engage other women in the industry. I hope to someday mentor other students who are interested in attending a bootcamp to learn programming. When I'm not learning new coding skills you can often find me hiking the headlands or on a boat whale watching. As an SF Mission native I am also passionate about tacos. </p>

      <p>Chewie? Chewie, is that you? Ah! Chew--Chewie! Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on? Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody. All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed. If your people fixed the hyperdrive. All the coordinates are set. It's now or never. Punch it!</p>
